Def: the rapid application development or RAD model is based on prototyping and iterative model with no specific planning.
In general RAD approach to software development means putting lesser emphasis on planning tasks and more emphasis on development and coming up with a prototype.
RAD puts clear focus on prototyping, which acts as an alternative to design specifications.
This means that RAD works well wherever there's a greater focus on user interface rather than non-GUI programs.
The RAD model includes agile method and spiral model.

Below phases are in rapid application development (RAD) model: 

1.Business modeling
2.Data modeling
3.Process modeling
4.Application generation
5.Testing and turnover

Advantages of RAD Model	
1.Flexible and adaptable to changes.
2.It is useful when you have to reduce the overall project risk.
3.It is adaptable and flexible to changes.
4.It is easier to transfer deliverables as scripts, high-level abstractions and intermediate codes are used.
5.Due to prototyping in nature, there is a possibility of lesser defects.

Disadvantages of RAD Model
1.It can’t be used for smaller projects.
2.Not all application is compatible with RAD.
3.If developers are not committed to delivering software on time, RAD projects can fail.
4.Reduced features due to time boxing, where features are pushed to a later version to finish a release in short period.
5.Requires highly skilled designers or developers
